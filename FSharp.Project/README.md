This library is based on the original ProjectCracker and ProjectCrackerTool source code without any textual changes so far.

At the moment the preprocessor symbol NETSTANDARD1_6 is defined so that the ProjectCracker API calls directly into the ProjectCrackerTool API without running the ProjectCrackerTool as a separate executable.
